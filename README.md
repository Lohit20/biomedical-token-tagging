# 🧬 Biomedical Abbreviation Detection using BioBERT

This project focuses on detecting biomedical abbreviations and their corresponding long forms in scientific text using token classification techniques. Developed as part of the **COMM061 NLP module** at the **University of Surrey**, the system identifies abbreviations and expansions using transformer models and serves them through an interactive chatbot.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Biomedical texts often contain complex abbreviations that vary in context and meaning. The goal of this project is to build a model that accurately tags abbreviations (AC) and long forms (LF) using BIO tagging format:
- `B-AC` – Beginning of an abbreviation
- `B-LF` – Beginning of a long form
- `I-LF` – Inside of a long form
- `O` – Outside (not a named entity)

---

## 🧪 Model Evaluation

We tested two models using the [PLOD-CW-25](https://huggingface.co/datasets/surrey-nlp/PLOD-CW-25) dataset:

| Model       | F1 Score | Recall  | Precision | Accuracy |
|-------------|----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| BioBERT     | 0.8464   | 0.8847  | 0.8113    | 93.11%   |
| DistilBERT  | 0.8130   | 0.8733  | 0.7604    | 92.94%   |

**BioBERT** was chosen for deployment due to its superior performance and domain-specific training.

## 📈 Additional Experiments

- **Data Augmentation:** Trained BioBERT with increasing subsets (5%, 10%, 15%) of the [PLODv2-filtered](https://huggingface.co/datasets/surrey-nlp/PLODv2-filtered) dataset for better generalization.
- **Loss Functions Tested:**
  - Cross-Entropy Loss (CE)
  - Weighted Cross-Entropy (WCE)
  - Focal Loss (FL)  
  Focal Loss showed best recall and stable training on imbalanced data.

## 💬 Chatbot Interface

The chatbot lets users input biomedical text and returns real-time token classification results via:

* Flask + HTML (Jinja2 templates)
* CSS-styled chat interface
* JavaScript with AJAX for real-time responses

---

## 🧾 Logging System

All predictions are logged into `token_predictions.json` in structured JSON format.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-05-15T15:44:24.617326",
  "bio_ner_tags": [
    {"token": "hc", "label": "B-LF", "entity_type": "Long Form"},
    {"token": "c", "label": "B-AC", "entity_type": "Abbreviation"}
  ]
}
```

Each log includes:

* Timestamp
* Tokens with predicted BIO labels
* Human-readable entity type (e.g., Abbreviation, Long Form)

---

## ⚙️ Model Loading Example

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Lohit20/biobert-v1.2-base-cased-v1.2-ner")
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("Lohit20/biobert-v1.2-base-cased-v1.2-ner")
```

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Recommendations

* Flask is single-threaded; not ideal for concurrent users.
* Use `gunicorn` or `FastAPI` for production deployment.
* Add GPU support or use Hugging Face Inference API for scalability.
* Use Redis queues + Celery for async request handling in production.
